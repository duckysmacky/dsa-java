# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project presents custom implementations of different data structures and algorithms written in Java.

## About

This is a sandbox environment to practice my knowledge of different DSA topics. Java was selected for purely experience
and overall development comfort reasons, so most of the presented data structures are implemented
**language-independently**. 

Still, they include some Java-specific features, like exceptions. This was simply to make development easier and
to provide myself some clean architectural design. My goal was to use as little of standard library classes and features 
as possible and make everything dsa-related from the ground up.
